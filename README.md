# Make Google Image Search Great Again!

Google [decided to remove "View image" button](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17017864/google-removes-view-image-button-from-search-results) from its image search,
possibly in results of [its new parternship](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/after-partnering-with-getty-google-kills-view-image-button-from-search-results/articleshow/62942789.cms).

So this web extension simply adds "View Image" button to Google Image Search results again.
